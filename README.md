# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis
The Twitter Sentiment Analysis project is a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) project that aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to a specific topic or event. The project involves collecting tweets from Twitter, preprocessing the data, and applying machine learning algorithms to classify the tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Project Objectives**
The primary objectives of the project are:

1.To collect and preprocess tweets related to a specific topic or event

2.To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral

3.To evaluate the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics

4.To visualize the results of the sentiment analysis to gain insights into public opinion

**Libraries Used**

1.NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

Purpose: NLTK is a popular Python library used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides tools for text processing, tokenization, stemming, and tagging.
Why: NLTK is used for preprocessing the tweet text, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming or lemmatization. These steps are essential for preparing the text data for sentiment analysis.

2.Scikit-learn

Purpose: Scikit-learn is a machine learning library for Python that provides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks.
Why: Scikit-learn is used to develop and train a machine learning model for sentiment analysis. It provides algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines, which can be used to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

3.Matplotlib and Seaborn

Purpose: Matplotlib and Seaborn are data visualization libraries for Python. They provide tools for creating plots, charts, and other visualizations.
Why: Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to visualize the results of the sentiment analysis, including the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral tweets. They help us to gain insights into public opinion and understand the sentiment trends.

4.Pandas

Purpose: Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures such as DataFrames and Series, which can be used to store and manipulate data.
Why: Pandas is used to store and manipulate the tweet data, including preprocessing and feature extraction. It provides efficient data structures and operations for handling large datasets.

5.NumPy

Purpose: NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and provides a wide range of high-performance mathematical functions.
Why: NumPy is used to perform numerical computations and array operations, which are essential for machine learning and data analysis tasks.
